## Security Practices

This project follows these security practices:

- **No secrets in code** — All credentials are passed via configuration at runtime, never hardcoded
- **Provider SDK isolation** — AI provider SDKs are peer/optional dependencies; credentials are passed via `ProviderConfig.credentials` at construction time, never read from `process.env` after initialization
- **stdout reserved** — stdout is exclusively for the MCP wire protocol; all logging goes to stderr
- **Input validation** — All MCP tool inputs are validated via Zod schemas before processing
- **Backpressure** — Concurrent request limiting prevents resource exhaustion
- **Dependency auditing** — Automated weekly dependency audits via GitHub Actions
- **CodeQL analysis** — Static analysis runs on every push to main and weekly
